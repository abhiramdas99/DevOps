Install java 1.8
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64
Bash
After the installation, you can confirm it by running the following command:

java -version
Bash
This command will tell you about the Java runtime environment that you have installed:

openjdk version "1.8.0_91"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-b14)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode)
Bash
In order to help Java-based applications locate the Java virtual machine properly, you need to set two environment variables: JAVAHOME and JREHOME.

sudo cp /etc/profile /etc/profile_backup
echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
echo 'export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
source /etc/profile
Bash
Finally, you can print them for review:

echo $JAVA_HOME
echo $JRE_HOME
